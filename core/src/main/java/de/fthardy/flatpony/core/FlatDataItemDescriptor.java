/**
 * The interface for a flat data item descriptor.
 * <p>
 * A flat data item descriptor describes a particular data section of a character (flat data) stream. Each descriptor
 * implementation has a corresponding item entity implementation. Both implementations are tightly coupled and represent
 * the item as a unit. In other words: a (flat data) item is only a conceptual term which is represented by a pair of a
 * descriptor and entity implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The descriptor serves as a factory for creating new instances of the entity. A descriptor can be used to create as
 * many entities as desired. Each of the entity instances has a reference to the descriptor instance that created it.
 * There are two ways to create an entity. Either create a new entity instance by calling {@link #createItemEntity()} or by
 * reading from a given character stream by calling {@link #readItemEntityFrom(Reader)}.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the item produced by the descriptor.
